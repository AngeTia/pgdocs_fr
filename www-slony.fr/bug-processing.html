		<h1>Slony-I Bug Processing</h1>
			
		<p> Slony bug tracking is being managed using <a
		href="http://www.bugzilla.org/"> Bugzilla.</a></p>
			
		<p> Here is the <a href="http://www.slony.info/bugzilla/"> Slony-I
		Bugzilla Instance </a>.

		<h1> Bug Management Process </h1>

		<p> <a href=
		"http://www.slony.info/bugzilla/docs/en/html/lifecycle.html"> Bug
		Lifecycle Documentation </a> uses the following image <img
		src="http://www.slony.info/bugzilla/docs/en/images/bzLifecycle.png">
		to characterize the flow of work on bugs, through various states, as
		they (hopefully!) get fixed.

		<p> The following interpretations are suggested.

		<h2> NEW </h2>
		<a name="NEW">

		<P> When a bug is created, it is created with <B>NEW</B> state, is
		assigned to <tt>slony1-bugs@lists.slony.info</tt>, and an email is
		sent to the bug tracking list.

		<P> At this point, someone on the Slony development team should
		examine the bug to ascertain what, if anything, should be done with
		it.

		<P> It may be appropriate to:
		<ul>

		<li> Assign it to someone that is expected to work on it, changing the
		owner, and change the status to <a href="#ASSIGNED">ASSIGNED</A>.

		<li> Perhaps the bug is trivially resolved, in which case, it is
		reasonable to jump straight to marking it <a
		href="#RESOLVED">RESOLVED</a>.

		<li> Perhaps the bug is invalid.  Jump straight to <a href=
		"#RESOLVED">RESOLVED</a>.

		<li> Perhaps it is unclear who should work on it.  Perhaps the bug
		should be left alone, or perhaps it should be <a
		href="#ASSIGNED">ASSIGNED</A> to someone who might know who
		<i>should</i> do the work.

		</ul>

		<h2> ASSIGNED </h2>
		  <a name="ASSIGNED">

		<P> This is the state of bugs that belong to <i>someone</i>.  That
		someone should presumably be a human, and not
		<tt>slony1-bugs@lists.slony.info</tt>.

		<h2> RESOLVED </h2>
		  <a name="RESOLVED">

		<P> This is the state of bugs that have been addressed, after some
		fashion.

		<P> There are several possible resolutions:
		<ul>
		<li> <B>FIXED</B> - believed to be resolved
		<li> <B>DUPLICATE</B> - this apparently duplicates some previous bug
		<li> <B>WONTFIX</B> - a problem that we don't plan to address
		<li> <B>WORKSFORME</B> - the developer can't duplicate the issue
		<li> <B>INVALID</B> - the problem is considered part of the proper behaviour of Slony
		</ul>

		<P> Note that this is <i>not the end</i> of the lifecycle!

		<P> If a developer has a patch for a complex issue, it is appropriate to:
		<ul>
		<li> Attach a patch, or perhaps a reference to a Git commit for the proposed fix.
		<li> Mark the bug <B>RESOLVED/FIXED</B>
		<li> Reassign the bug, either to:
		  <ul>
		    <li> The person that reported the bug
		    <li> The <tt>slony1-bugs@lists.slony.info</tt> user
		    <li> A specific Slony developer that is to validate the fix as <a name="#VERIFIED"> VERIFIED</a>
		  </ul>

		<h2> VERIFIED </h2>
		  <a name="VERIFIED">

		<P> A developer (or user) takes a <a href="#RESOLVED">RESOLVED</a> bug, and evaluates
		whether the resolution provided is proper.

		<P> The same resolution values apply:
		<ul>
		<li> <B>FIXED</B> - believed to be resolved
		<li> <B>DUPLICATE</B> - this apparently duplicates some previous bug
		<li> <B>WONTFIX</B> - a problem that we don't plan to address
		<li> <B>WORKSFORME</B> - the developer can't duplicate the issue
		<li> <B>INVALID</B> - the problem is considered part of the proper behaviour of Slony
		</ul>

		<P> At this point, for complex patches, we can consider that the patch
		has been <B>verified</B> to be valid to be committed and released.

		<P> The bug might be re-assigned back to the original developer to do
		the commit.  But wait, it's not <a href="#CLOSED">CLOSED</a> yet...

		<H2> CLOSED </h2>
		  <a name="CLOSED">

		<P> The final destination for a Slony bug is for it to be closed.  The
		fix should have passed through phases of being <a href="#ASSIGNED">
		ASSIGNED</a> <a href="#RESOLVED"> RESOLVED</a> <a name="#VERIFIED">
		VERIFIED</a>.  For particularly simple bugs, or for issues considered
		to <i>not really be bugs</i>, these phases may be rather brief.

		<P> A bug being marked <B>CLOSED</B> should indicate that we have put
		it into some specific release, and placed a suitable reference into
		the release notes.

		<H2> REOPENED </h2>

		<P> Oh, no, the <b>zombie bug!</b>

		<P> Sometimes bugs aren't solved in the first attempt, and need to be
		reopened.  This is pretty much equivalent to <a href="#ASSIGNED">
		ASSIGNED</a>.
